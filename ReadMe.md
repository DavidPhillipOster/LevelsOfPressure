10/03/2015 - Demonstrates that Pre-6s hardware can detect the difference
between a light touch and a heavy one. iOS 8 and up.

Yes, it's really the major radius of the contact area of the touch, but close enough for you to
play around with it.

In Xcode, change the Project's Target's general settings, 'bundle id to yours, set up your team, and compile and run it on your device.

Try touching lightly. Try touching hard. You can touch with multiple fingers at once.
